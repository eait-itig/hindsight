.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bunyan-rotate
.Nd rotate (read and maybe truncate) a log file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl FMTz
.Op Fl l Ar level
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Ar input
.Ar filename_format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility "rotates" the data out of an append only log by opening the
input file, reading the data out of it into a separate output file,
and then truncating the input file.
The log data can optionally be compressed with
.Xr gzip 1 ,
and checksummed with the
MD5 and SHA256
digest algorithms as it is written to the output file.
.Pp
The log file to be rotated is specified with the
.Ar input
argument.
The destination file is specified with the
.Ar filename_format
argument.
By default, the
.Ar filename_format
argument is parsed with
.Xr strftime 3
so the time at which the output file is created can be embedded in
the file name.
This parsing can be disabled with the
.Fl T
option.
.Pp
Because
.Nm
copies the data from the input file to the output file instead of
using
.Xr rename 2 ,
the output file may exist on a separate mountpoint.
This also allows processes that are appending to the log file to
continue to do so without having to reopen their log files.
This is unlike
.Xr newsyslog 8 ,
which renames log files, creates new ones, and then notifies the
processes writing to their log files that they must be reopened.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl F
Do not process the
.Ar filename_format
argument with
.Xr strftime 3 .
The ouput filename argument will be used as the output file name directly.
.It Fl l Ar level
Specify the compression level used if compressed output is enabled.
Compression level
.Ar 1
is the fastest, but provides a poorer level of compression.
Compression level
.Ar 9
provides the best level of compression, but is relatively slow.
The default is
.Ar 6 .
.It Fl M
Generate a JSON file containing metadata about the log file input.
The meta data file is the ouput file name suffixed with .meta.
The JSON contains the name of the input file, the length of the
input data in bytes, and the MD5 and SHA256 digests encoded as
hexadecimal strings.
.It Fl s Ar size
Only process the input file if it is larger than
.Ar size
bytes.
The size may be specified with a
B, K, M, G, T, P or E suffix (in either upper or lower case) for
Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, Exabyte
(computed using powers of two, i.e., Megabyte = 1024*1024).
.It Fl T
Do not truncate the input log file.
.It Fl z
Compress the log data in the output file.
